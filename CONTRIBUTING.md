# Contributing Guidelines

## Formatting
Ensure that your code is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) before
opening a pull request—this is configured automatically via Git hooks, through
the `postinstall` NPM script.

> You should see a pre-commit message, *"Passed Prettier check!"* upon 
> committing. If you don't, please manually run `yarn prettier` to make sure
> your code is properly formatted!

*That's all for now, happy contributing! Thanks for being a part of this project*
😊.
